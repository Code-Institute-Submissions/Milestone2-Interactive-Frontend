<h1> Introduction of The memory game </h1>

This classic memory card game is intended to be played by two players. It serves to train memory skills and can be played by all ages.
It is a demonstration of different techniques of HTML 5.0, CSS 3, JQUERY and JAVASCRIPT I have tried in my labtime so far and combines them all together in this project.

<h2> Userstories </h2>

As a user, I want to test my memory skills and play against another player to have a competition.
The game should be loaded quickly, provide an easy to understand layout and rules to play.

The only difference between mobile and desktop landscape are some minor changes in fontsize.

So the space in landscape is basically divided into section for controlpanel (1/3 of screen width) and playfield (2/3 of screen width.

In portrait mode, the control and playfield are stacked up and fit nicely in viewport. No scrolling involved.

The target was to cover all mobile and desktop sizes. To achieve this I have created 4 breakpoints. Two for aspect ration 1.77 (mobile devices, portrait and landscape mode) and two for aspect ratio 1.33 (ipad and ipad pro, portrait and landscape mode).
